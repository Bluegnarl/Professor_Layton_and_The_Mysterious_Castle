# Professor Layton and the Mysterious Castle

A game inspired by the "Professor Layton" franchise.

## Concept of the Franchise

Professor Layton is a game series filled with simple and complex puzzles to solve, accompanied by an engaging story that is itself a mystery.

## Story Summary

The story takes place in London, where Professor Hershel Layton, along with his young assistant Luke Triton (or Flora Reinhold if the player is female), receives a letter from a duke inviting them to his castle to solve a mystery. Upon their arrival, the duke greets them warmly before disappearing without a trace. The goal is to uncover what is happening in this castle and discover the mystery it holds. 

As they explore the castle, they find clues and solve puzzles that lead them to an unfinished letter from the duke. This letter mentions an "undesirable guest" and hints that the master of the house is trying to protect a family treasure. As they progress, Layton and his assistant meet various characters, including one seemingly harmless guest whose behavior intrigues them. 

Eventually, the duke reappears in the depths of the castle, accompanied by the suspicious guest, who turns out to be his brother. The two explain that they have long been at odds over the family treasure. However, after discussions and Layton's efforts to ease the tensions, they decide to share the inheritance.

## Mini-games

In this game, players will have the opportunity to experience not just one, but several varied mini-games. Firstly, there will be simple guessing games, where the player will need to click on the right element to solve the puzzle. Additionally, one or more more complex mini-games are planned.

## Use of localStorage

The form will allow the player to enter their name and gender. Depending on the choice, the player will either have Luke or Flora as an assistant.

For data storage, I will use localStorage to save the player's progress after significant actions (e.g., completing a mini-game). The player will be able to resume their game from where they left off. For example, progress in the story, collected clues, or the list of completed mini-games will be saved in localStorage.

### Responsive Design and Layout

The game will feature a responsive layout, ensuring it works well across different screen sizes:

- **Flexible Layouts:** The game screens will adjust automatically to the player's device, including mobile and desktop.
- **Scaling:** When the screen becomes too small, the game will scale to maintain full visibility of the screens, ensuring the primary and secondary screens stay correctly proportioned while adjusting to available space.

### Interactive and Dynamic Elements

The game will include interactive elements that respond to player input:

- **Click Events:** Players will interact with various objects by clicking on them to solve puzzles or uncover clues.
- **Story Progression:** The narrative will progress dynamically based on puzzle outcomes and decisions made by the player.

## Future Features

As development continues, additional features and mini-games will be added to enhance the gameplay experience, offering more variety in puzzles and interactions.
